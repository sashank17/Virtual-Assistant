# Virtual-Assistant
This is a python voice assistant which can tell you the time and weather of any place in the world.
I use Microsoft azure for text-to-speech conversion and Azure maps to identify the locations around the world and get their timezones.
I use python nltk package to analyze the speech and identify the places from the users query.


This is currently a very small project and looking forward to expand it in the future!
